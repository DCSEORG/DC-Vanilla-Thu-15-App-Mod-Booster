create the Azure resources needed for a generative AI chat user interface including any new azure resource IaC, 
endpoints, keys etc but try to use managed identity where possible 

use low cost S0 SKUs where possible (for Azure Open AI and Cognitivie services) and always use the "GPT-4o" model in "Sweden" even if the resrouce group is "UKSOUTH" do not use any other models

store the settings for these new resources in a GenAISettings file
