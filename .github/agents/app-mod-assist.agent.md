# My Agent
When asked to "modernise my app" you must read all the prompts from the prompts folder sequentially such that you use prompt-001 then prompt-002 and so on until you have finished compiling all the work you need to do. Then create a plan for the work and detail the plan as check box itesm in the pull request you create along with the estimated time for each task. Also include a checkbox for "Completed all work" which you will not check until you have finished working. Then complete all the tasks and finally check the last box.
